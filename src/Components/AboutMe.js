          <p>Hey there! Glad you could stop by. My name is Chrysalis or Chrys (pronounced as Chris) for short.</p>
          <br></br>
          <p>My passion for coding was sparked when I joined Saturday Kids as a Programming Instructor back in 2018 while I was still studying. Through this experience, I was able to develop a deep skill set in simplifying programming concepts that I used to teach students, resulting in enabling my students to feel that programming is a lot more accessible. That role inspired me to learn more about programming and I really became passionate about finding ways to simplify programming concepts and ideas. </p>
